Phase 1 Features (MVP - Keep it Simple)
What to build first (2-3 weeks):
✅ Must Have:

Service provider registration with basic details
Service browsing by category
Provider profile with phone/WhatsApp button
Basic search/filter
Click to call/WhatsApp (no in-app booking yet)

❌ Skip for now:

Complex booking system
Payment integration
In-app chat
Real-time notifications
Admin panel

Why this works:

Users can browse and contact providers directly
Providers get leads
You validate the idea
No complex infrastructure needed

Create basic pages (Home, Register, Browse)
Design service cards and forms
Deploy to Vercel

Week 2: Backend & Database

Setup Supabase/Firebase
Create database schema
Build authentication
Create API routes
Connect frontend to backend

Week 3: Core Features

Service provider registration flow
Service browsing with filters
Provider profile pages
WhatsApp/Call integration
Basic search functionality

Week 4: Polish & Launch

Free Deployment Guide
Frontend:
bash# Deploy to Vercel (Free)
1. Push code to GitHub
2. Go to vercel.com
3. Import GitHub repository
4. Deploy (takes 2 minutes)
Backend:
bash# If using Render.com (Free)
1. Create web service
2. Connect GitHub repo
3. Auto-deploys on every push
```

**Database:**
- Supabase: Just sign up and create project
- Firebase: Enable services from console
- MongoDB: Create free cluster on Atlas

---

## **Estimated Costs**

**Month 1-6: $0**
- Everything runs on free tiers
- Up to 500 users easily

**After Growth (>1000 users):**
- Supabase Pro: $25/month
- OR Firebase Blaze: ~$5-20/month (pay as you go)
- Domain: $10/year (.in domain)
- SMS (if needed): $10-20/month

---

## **Important Notes**

**1. Start WITHOUT these (add later):**
- Native mobile app
- Payment gateway
- Complex booking system
- Admin dashboard
- Real-time chat

**2. Use these FREE features:**
- WhatsApp Business (click to chat)
- Google Forms (initial provider onboarding)
- Google Sheets (track early bookings manually)
- Phone calls (direct contact)

**3. Validation First:**
- Get 10-20 providers registered
- Get 50-100 users browsing
- See if people actually use it
- Then add advanced features

---

## **Reality Check**

**What you CAN build free:**
- Professional-looking website
- Provider listings
- Search and filter
- User registration
- Direct contact (call/WhatsApp)
- Basic reviews

**What needs payment later:**
- Large-scale SMS notifications (>1000/day)
- Heavy file storage (>5GB)
- Video content
- Advanced analytics
- Native mobile app (can still do Progressive Web App free)

---

## **My Recommendation: Start with This**
